= Node / React Neo4j Movies Template
:img: ./img

== Introduction

Let’s jump right into it.
You’re a JavaScript developer interested in Neo4j and want to build a web app, microservice, or mobile app.
You’ve already read up on Neo4j, played around with some datasets, and know enough Cypher to get going.
Now you’re looking for a demo app or template to get the ball rolling. 

Enter the Neo4j Movies Template. 

What comes with the Neo4j Movies Template:

* Node - https://expressjs.com/[Express] / https://facebook.github.io/react/[React] app ready to be bent to your will
* API Documentation
** More time coding, less time Googling for examples on how to
*** Use http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/deployment/#import-tool-usage[neo4j-import] on Unix or Windows
*** Use the new https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver[JavaScript Bolt driver for Neo4j] 

== Overview of the Model and the Implementation

=== The Classic Movie Database

This project uses a classic Neo4j dataset: the movie database. 
It includes `Movie`, `Person`, `Genre`, and `Keyword` nodes, connected by relationships as described in the following image:

//TODO replace with arrows tool image

image::{img}/image00_model.png[]

* `(:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre)`
* `(:Movie)-[:HAS_KEYWORD]->(:Keyword)`
* `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)`
* `(:Person)-[:WROTE]->(:Movie)`
* `(:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)`
* `(:Person)-[:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)`

Additionally, users can add ratings to movies:

image::{img}/user_ratings_graph.svg[]

* `(:User)-[:RATED]->(:Movie)`

Or, in table form:

=== The API

The Node portion of the application interfaces with the database and presents data to the React frontend via a RESTful API. 

=== The Frontend

The frontend, built in React, consumes the data presented by the Express API and presents some views to the end user, including:

* Home page
* Movie detail page
* Person detail page
* User detail page
* Login

== Setting Up

To get the project running, https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-template[clone the repo] then check the project’s https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-template/blob/master/README.md[README] for environment-specific setup instructions. 

The README covers how to:

* download and install Neo4j
* prepare the database 
* import the nodes and relationships using `neo4j-import`
* start the database

=== Start the Node Backend

The Neo4j-powered https://expressjs.com/[Express] API lives in the `api` directory.

In order to run the API, you’ll need to open a new terminal tab and move to the `api` directory install dependencies using `npm install`:

----
cd api
npm install
----

If you are new to node and your terminal does not know the command `npm`, make sure you have installed node, perhaps choosing https://github.com/creationix/nvm[`nvm`] to manage your version of node (I’m using node v6.2.1). 

After you’ve installed your dependencies and have your database running, enter your database username and password into the appropriate place in the `api/config.js` file:

----
'use strict';

var nconf = require('nconf');

var USERNAME = 'neo4j';   // use your username
var PASSWORD = '123123';    // use your password

nconf.env(['PORT', 'NODE_ENV'])
....
----

Start the API then navigate to http://localhost:3000/docs/ to see the projects' Swagger docs.

----
node app.js
open http://localhost:3000/docs/
----

== Start the React Frontend

With the database and express backend running, open a new terminal tab or window and move to the project's `/web` subdirectory. 
Install the bower and npm dependencies, then start the app by running gulp (read the “getting started” on [gulpjs.com]gulpjs.com if this is your first time using gulp). 

----
npm install
bower install
gulp
----

Over on http://localhost:4000/, you should see the homepage of the movie app, displaying three featured movies and other movies below.

image::{img}/image04_homepage.png[]

Click on a movie to see the movie detail page:

image::{img}/image07_movie_detail.png[]

Click on a person to see that person’s related persons and movies the person has acted in, directed, written, or produced:

image::{img}/image03_person_detail.png[]

== A Closer Look: Using the JavaScript Neo4j Bolt Driver

Let’s take a closer look at what sort of responses we get from the bolt driver.
In this app, calls to the database are handled by `/api/neo4j/dbUtils.js`, described piece by piece below. 

Import dependencies, including the neo4j driver, and connect the driver to the database:

[source,javascript]
.Getting Ready
----
var nconf = require('../config');
var neo4j = require('neo4j-driver').v1;
var driver = neo4j.driver(nconf.get('neo4j-local'), neo4j.auth.basic(nconf.get('USERNAME'), nconf.get('PASSWORD')));
----

Let’s look at how we would ask the database to return all the genres in the database. 
`getAll`, a function in `/api/models/genres.js` submits a Cypher query and passes the result from the database through the `_manyGenres` function, which maps the results into a usable form and deals with converting Neo4j Integers to JavaScript numbers. 

[source,javascript]
./api/models/genres.js
----
var _ = require('lodash');
var Genre = require('../models/neo4j/genre');

var getAll = function(session) {
  return session.run('MATCH (genre:Genre) RETURN genre')
    .then(_manyGenres);
};

var _manyGenres = function (result) {
  return result.records.map(r => new Genre(r.get('genre')));
};

module.exports = {
  getAll: getAll
};
----

[source,javascript]
./api/models/neo4j/genre.js
----
// extracts just the data from the query results

var _ = require('lodash');

var Genre = module.exports = function (_node) {
  _.extend(this, _node.properties);
  if (this.id) { 
    this.id = this.id.toNumber();
  };
};
;
----

=== What's going on with the Cypher?

The bolt driver responses are different than what you might be used to if you've used a non-Bolt Neo4j driver.  

In the "get all Genres" example described above, `MATCH (genre:Genre) RETURN genre` returns results quite different what you would see in the Neo4j browser upon clicking *code* in the result widget. 

./api/models/genres.js
----
var getAll = function(session) {
  return session.run('MATCH (genre:Genre) RETURN genre')
    .then(_manyGenres);
};
----

`records` (not `data`!) coming out:

[source,json]
.Response from the Bolt Driver
----
{  
   records:Record   {  
      keys:[  
         'genre'
      ],
      length:1,
      _fields:[  
         Node         {  
            identity:Integer            {  
               low:737,
               high:0
            },
            labels:[  
               'Genre'
            ],
            properties:{  
               name:'Suspense',
               id:Integer               {  
                  low:3270,
                  high:0
               }
            }
         ],
         _fieldLookup:{  
            genre:0
         }
      },
      ... // more records
   ],
   summary:ResultSummary   {  
      statement:{  
         text:'MATCH (genre:Genre)\nRETURN genre',
         parameters:{  

         }
      },
      statementType:'r',
      updateStatistics:StatementStatistics      {  
         _stats:[  
            Object
         ]
      },
      plan:false,
      profile:false,
      notifications:[  

      ]
   }
}
----

In order to grab the `genre` node(s), we could use something like `record.get('genre')` to pluck it out of the longer response:

[source,json]
.Response from the Bolt Driver
----
Node {  
   identity:Integer   {  
      low:735,
      high:0
   },
   labels:[  
      'Genre'
   ],
   properties:{  
      name:'Family',
      id:Integer	{  
         low:1258,
         high:0
      }
   }
}
----

This is *much* better, but still not usable: the `id` property is not what we expected. 

The return function, `_manyGenres` works with the `Genre` object to parse the messy results into the data we need to build a useful API:

[source,javascript]
----
var _manyGenres = function (result) {
  return result.records.map(r => new Genre(r.get('genre')));
};
----

Viola!
An array of genres appears at `/genres`.

== Beyond the /Genres Endpoint

Of course, an app that just shows movie genres isn’t very interesting.
Take a look at the routes and models used to build the home page, movie detail page, and person detail page. 

== Next Steps

* https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-template[Fork the repo] and hack away! Find directors that work with multiple genres, or find people who happen to work with each other often as writer-director pairs. 
* Find a way to improve the template or the JS driver? Make a GitHub Issue and/or submit a pull request.
